# GSUTIL {#gsutil}

## Google Buckets
To upload data to a google bucket cp from the source.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
gsutil cp [OBJECT_LOCATION] gs://[DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME]/
```

Interacting with the data is pretty similar to other bash commands with a prepended `gsutil` command.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
gsutil mv [OBJECT_LOCATION] gs://[DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME]/
```

This gets a list of files and locations within a particular directory.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
echo gs://[DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME]/
```

Moving mutiple a large number of files there might be a significant performance gain by using a multi-threaded/multi-processing move.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
gsutil -m mv gs://my_bucket/oldprefix gs://my_bucket/newprefix
```
